# REGconsole
Random Event Generator is a program that simulates custom decks full of cards. Decks are filefolders, card are txt files. You can interact with it  in console.

This app was created to automatize some aspects for our (myself and my sister) modification of Minecraft The modification contains zero lines of code, and based on our conciosness rules
The rules are basicly turning Minecraft into a strategy game, Civilization-like game
With the Project growing larger, it's getting more and more harder to maintain some random events, which occured in every state every turn
The Events are based on goverment type, amount of population and some laws
Paper card system cann't be normally used at this point: it takes around one hour just to start a turn
So I put on my dedication and creativity to create this needfull (for me) project.
