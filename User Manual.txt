							How to use REG

First question needs to be "Why to use REG?".
And it is quite simple: to help you with simulations and random events, which should occur.

So, REG has two working mods: either one-card pick, or multiple card pick.


Question: Can you use multiple pick with one card?
Yes, you can. One-card pick can be used for annual events, for example.
For all events that meant to occur once per something. They are not dependant on size or activity - they are unescapable, yet rare.

Multiple card pick events are dependant on size, activity or just your mood. One event per 10 people per town, as an example.


Question: How does REG work?
In order to pick a card, REG must first get a deck. To put it simple - it is a folder with some .txt files. They are your cards.
Decks are stored inside larger directories. There are three of them:

CardSamples - stores originals of cards for PeoplePerRealmDecks.
PeoplePerRealmDecks - stores multiple pick decks. (also reffered as PPRD)
StateTypeDecks - stores one-card pick decks. (also reffered as STD)


Question: What purpose serves CardSamples folder?
It stores originals of cards for PPRD. Cards for STD are unique, but many PPRD have repeating cards. It just saves your time, when filling new deck.
Also REG requires all cards to end with "- Copy().txt".


Question: Are there other special requerments for cards?
Apart form "- Copy().txt" ending, which can be achieved via copy and paste of original file, there are two more:

Card must be .txt file with strictly 2 lines in it.
First line called "description". Just an explanation, what the card does.
Second line called "arrival note". Explains why the card is in that deck.

Card name must not contain '-' symbol, with an exeption of the one before "Copy()".

Note, that that part of card's full name before '-' is the name, that part will be shown, when card is taken.


Question: How can I choose a deck?
When REG starts, it is waiting for you to type deckname. Just type STD name into console.


Question: Is it that simple?
Yes, but it does not end just here. After REG outputs a card, it is waiting for your reaction. You have 3 different options: 

Press "Enter" key to finish action with this card.
Express your exitment or disappointment via typing in console and get silent, understanding reaction form REG.
Use some special commands. (about them later)


Question: How can I choose a PPRD?
Just as STD, but with a number of cards to be taken. Use Space as a separator.
After that you will get an interaction with every card taken.


Question: So, what are the special commands?
Firstly, there is "quit". It ... quits REG. It also can be used even if there is no deck chosen.

Command "what" outputs you card's description.
Command "why" outputs you card's arrival note.
Command "what why" combines previous two commands.

Command "coin" randomly selects heads or tails. (0-1 random)
Command "dice" randomly selects one of the six side of a cube. (1-6 random)

Command "super dice" allows user to use a dice with custom amount of sides.
It will ask for amount from user and return random mumber. (usefull for d20, or percents)

Note, that commands have no question marks and separator is "Space".


Question: What happens, when all picked cards were shown?
Afer that, deck closes itself. You can either choose another deck or quit.
